# NitroGrafx V0.9.0
PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 emulator for NDS

This is a PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 emulator for the NDS, it can also emulate
some of the (Super) CD-ROM^2 & Arcade Card. All games are not perfect, (alot
of US games doesn't work because they are encrypted, use PCEToy or the
emulator Ootake to decrypt these before you use them). Don't use overdumps as
these are evil on PC Engine.

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "NitroGrafx" in either the root of your flash card or
 in the data directory (eg h:\NitroGrafx or h:\data\NitroGrafx). This is where
 settings and save files end up.
2. Now put your games into a folder where you have (PC-Engine) roms, max 768
 games per folder, filenames must not be longer than 127 chars. You can use
 zipped files (as long as they use the deflate compression).
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

The GUI is accessed by pressing L+R (shoulder buttons) or by touching the
screen, tabs are changed by pressing the L or R button, going to the left most
tab exits the GUI. Closing your DS puts the emulator in sleep mode, just open
it to resume.

When you first run the emulator I suggest you take a peak through the options
and change the settings to your liking and then save them. To be able to use
CD-ROM games you have to select a CD-ROM System rom (bios) from
Options-Machine-BiosSettings-SelectBios. You can use .iso files or .bin/.cue
files see CDROM_readme.txt for more info.

Now load up a game and you should be good to go.
