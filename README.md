# NitroGrafx V0.9.0
PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 emulator for NDS

This is a PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 emulator for the NDS, it can also
emulate some of the (Super) CD-ROM^2 & Arcade Card.
All games are not perfect, (alot of US games doesn't work because they are encrypted,
use PCEToy or the emulator Ootake to decrypt these before you use them).
Don't use overdumps as these are evil on PC Engine.

And this readme is still W.I.P.

## How to use:

Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator file.
You should also create a "NitroGrafx" directory either in the root of your card or in
the data directory (eg h:\NitroGrafx or h:\data\NitroGrafx).

Put your games on your flash card, max 768 games per folder (though shouldn't be
a problem).
Filenames must not be longer than 127 chars.
You can use zipped files (as long as they use the deflate compression).

The GUI is accessed by pressing L+R (shoulder buttons) or by touching the
screen, tabs are changed by pressing the L or R button, going to the left most
tab exits the GUI. Closing your DS puts the emulator in sleep mode, just open
it to resume.

When you first run the emulator I suggest you take a peak through the options
and change the settings to your liking and then save them.
To be able to use CD-ROM games you have to select a CD-ROM System rom (bios)
from Options-Machine-BiosSettings-SelectBios.
You can use .iso files or .bin/.cue files see CDROM_readme.txt for more info.

Now load up a game and you should be good to go.
