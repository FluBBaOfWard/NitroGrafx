Using CD-ROM with NitroGrafx:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be able to use PC-Engine/TurboGrafx16 CD-ROM games you have to:
1) Select a CD-ROM System rom from Options-Machine-BiosSettings-SelectBios.
2) Select a .iso file or a .cue file from a bin/cue combo.
3) Press the Start button when the CD-ROM System screen shows up.


Right now NitroGrafx supports loose .iso files for games that only has 1
data track (or 2 where the last one is a backup), or bin/cue files for complete
cd rips.

To rip your own CDs you can use Cdrwin, I downloaded V4.0G from their official
homepage http://www.goldenhawk.com/ , if you don't register it it will only
run at the slowest speed but that's actually a good thing for ripping old CDs.
1) Press the button for Extract Disc/Tracks/Sectors.
2) Select Correct CD drive.
3) Select output filename.
4) Make sure RAW is selected in the Reading Options.
5) Press the Start button.
6) Wait until completion, rip should be ready to use by NitroGrafx.

If you allready have ripped your games and have them as .iso + .wav files
make sure to:
1) Use TocFixer http://www.necstasy.net/uk/tuto09.php to check the rip.
2) Mount the .cue file in a virtual CD device like DAEMON Tools.
3) Use Cdrwin as on a normal CD.

Now you can test the .bin/.cue rip by mounting it in a virtual CD device
and running an emulator like Ootake or Magic Engine.
